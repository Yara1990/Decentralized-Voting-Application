A decentralized  voting application is an system  where one can  initialize a set of candidates who will be contesting in the election and then vote for the candidates. The votes will be stored on the blockchain which does not exist on a single central server. There are multiple copies of it across the internet on hundreds of computers. This makes it almost impossible to shut down the application.Voting on blockchain is fully decentralized, with no central authority to trust.
