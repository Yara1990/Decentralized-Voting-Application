Decentralized Voting Application
As part of this course, we will be building a simple decentralized voting application. A decentralized application is the one which does not exist on a single central server. There are multiple copies of it across the internet on hundreds of computers. This makes it almost impossible to shut down the application. You will build a voting application where you will initialize a set of candidates who will be contesting in the election and then vote for the candidates. The votes will be stored on the blockchain. You will go through the process of writing the voting contract, deploy to the blockchain and interact with it. As you go through the course, you will learn what a contract is and what it means to deploy it to the blockchain and interact with it.



Why decentralized voting?

There is a reason we picked voting as our first application to build. Collective decision making in general, and voting in particular represent a core value proposition for the Ethereum blockchain. Voting on blockchain is fully decentralized, with no central authority to trust. Voting is the building block on which many complex decentralized applications are built and the reason for choosing this project
